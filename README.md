## When will the game release
Project will be done within 3 months, with absolutely no guarantee!  
If things go well, we'll release on Steam.

## What to expect in this game
- Violence! Blood everywhere!
- Special weapons made by his organ
- Enormous amount of vegatable mobs challenging you
- Try to figure out the Doc's mysterious laboratory  

## Do I need to pay for it?
No, unless we decide to call it profitable.  
Since we can't guarantee the quality for our very first large project, we  
prefer gathering experience and attention than wealth.  
Moreover, we are a student team to do what we love.  
So just enjoy!
